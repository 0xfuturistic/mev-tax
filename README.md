# ðŸ©¸ MEV-Tax: A Solidity Library for MEV Taxes

MEV-Tax provides a simple way for developers to incorporate [MEV taxes](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2024/06/priority-is-all-you-need) into their contracts, enabling the contracts to automatically capture MEV.

## Features

- Easy integration with existing smart contracts
- Robust tax calculation based on transaction priority fee
- Customizable tax recipient
- Enables various use cases for MEV mitigation (e.g., DEX routers, AMMs, backrunning auctions)

## How it Works

Background: [Priority Is All You Need](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2024/06/priority-is-all-you-need) by Paradigm.


The library calculates a tax amount based on the priority fee per gas of the transaction. When a function with the `applyTax()` modifier is called, the library checks if the paid amount (`msg.value`) is sufficient to cover the tax. If so, the transaction proceeds, and the tax is transferred to the designated recipient. Otherwise, the transaction reverts.

## Getting Started

1. Install the library in your Solidity project
```bash
forge install 0xfuturistic/mev-tax
```
2. Import and inherit `MEVTax.sol` in your smart contract
```solidity
import "mev-tax/src/MEVTax.sol";
```
3. Apply the `applyTax()` modifier to functions where you want to capture MEV
4. Optionally, override the `_getTaxAmount()` function for a custom tax function

## Limitations

The library relies on the assumption of competitive priority ordering, which means it only works for L2s like Base and Optimism, where there's a trusted sequencer, but not for Ethereum Mainnet. Enforcing these rules trustlessly is an open problem.
